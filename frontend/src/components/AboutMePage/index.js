            <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>My name is Attiya Kovenburg. As a former pertroleum engineer
                    turned, software engineer, I developed an app that highlights
                    one of many of my passions, dogs! Using React/Redux, Javascript Express,
                    and CSS, I've created an app that was inspired by flickr, Pupperz. Pupperz is a
                    user friendly application where you can post you favorite pictures of your four
                    legged best friend or see pictures from other users. This app focuses on organizing
                    your photos by uploading them to albums that you can create on your own, easliy, with a
                    simple mouse click. You can edit or delete any photo or album anytime with ease as well. Every
                    picture can be uploaded with a description or added at a later time.
                </p>

                    <div>Choosing a new career in software development has been a challenging
                        but extremely rewarding decision for me and I'm so excited to be part of
                        the future of such a dynamic industry.
